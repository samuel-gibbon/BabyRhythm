These are the scripts associated with the paper [insert ref]. The data is available on request from Prof Usha Goswami (Centre for Neuroscience in Education, University of Cambridge). Due to the sensitive nature of the data, all request will go through a data access committee, and will likely only be granted to researchers affiliated with a higher education institution. 

EEG preprocessing is done in MATLAB, and Deep Learning (DL) is done in Python. For researchers interested in reproducing the DL results, you should request the "preprocessed EEG data", these files are relatively small. For researchers interested in reproducing the EEG preprocessing, you should request the "raw EEG", these files are very large.
